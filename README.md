# Calculator App - MiniMath

A cross-platform Calculator app built using Capacitor by Ionic with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases the versatility of Capacitor by transforming a web app codebase into a mobile application.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built with Capacitor to seamlessly run on Android and iOS.
- **Light and Dark Mode**: Smooth theme toggle for user-preferred appearance.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Simple UI**: Minimalist design for easy usability.

## Why Capacitor?

Capacitor enables us to convert a web application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS into a native mobile application. This allows for:

- Code reusability from web to mobile platforms.
- Simplified deployment and testing for Android and iOS.
- Access to native APIs without extensive native code.

## Tech Stack

- **Capacitor Framework**: Facilitates cross-platform compatibility.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Forms the core functionality and UI.
- **Ionic Capacitor CLI**: Used to build, run, and manage the mobile app.

## Installation and Setup
